## What is Open Model Cards?

Put simply: Open Model Cards is a way to lay out responsible machine learning model documentation in an easy to share and consume format, complete with interactive components and multimedia elements.  Leveraging the `create-react-app` project, we provide a simple method for compiling the resulting page into a single HTML file that can be hosted on a documentation server or personal website, or printed as a PDF for offline sharing.

Open Model Cards is based on the very visually attractive ["Google Model Cards"](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/model-reports) released by Google Research alongside the paper ["Model Cards for Model Reporting"](https://research.google/pubs/pub48120/).

## Why is Open Model Cards?

Open Model Cards aims to make machine learning model reporting easy-to-read, visually appealing, and flexible.  It should be easy to invlude interactive visualizations and embedded gifs and videos demonstrating model behaviour into documentation.  This is to improve the likelikhood of important documentation on ethical considerations and model limitations being read and understood by a broader audience.

This project was bootstrapped with (the lovely) [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

If you don't have any special requirements, you can build a beautiful model cards by simply editing the provided Markdown files in (directory).  If you want more fine-grained control, or want to embed say a Bokeh visualization, custom image, or similar, then you can edit the HTML directly in the provides js files under (directory).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
